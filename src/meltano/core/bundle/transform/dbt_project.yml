#### FILE PATH CONFIGURATIONS ####
##################################

# The following configs specify directories that dbt uses to operate. All
# paths are specified relative to the path of dbt_project.yml.

# ALL FILE PATH CONFIGURATIONS ARE OPTIONAL, the default values are listed below.

# source-paths: Specify which path(s) dbt should look in to find models. Model
# are.sql files. Model and source schema files (.yml files) should also be
# included in this path
source-paths: ["models"]

# analysis-paths: Specify which path(s) dbt should look in to find analytical
# queries. These queries are compiled, but not executed, by dbt.
analysis-paths: ["analysis"]

# test-paths: Specify which path(s) dbt should look in to find data test
# definitions.
test-paths: ["tests"]

# data-paths: Specify which path(s) dbt should look in to find CSV files.
# Running `dbt seed` will load these CSVs as tables in your warehouse.
data-paths: ["data"]

# macro-paths: Specify which path(s) dbt should look in to find macros. These
# macros will be globally available to all models in your project.

#### RESOURCE CONFIGURATIONS ####
#################################

# The following section contains configurations that define how your resources
# are instantiated by dbt. You can configure `models`, and `seeds` from here.
# You can configure resources from both your own project, and installed
# packages included as dependencies.
#
# Options are specified on a per-package, per-directory, and per-model basis.
# The configs are inherited, so configs applied to a package can be overridden
# for directories and models contained within that package.
#
# The configuration structure within a package should mirror the directory
# structure within that package. The example configs provided below are based
# on the following directory structure.
#
# dbt_project.yml
# models/
# ├── adwords
# │   └── adwords_ads.sql
# └── snowplow
#     ├── base
#     │   └── snowplow_events.sql
#     └── snowplow_sessions.sql

models:
  my_meltano_project: null
  enabled: true    # configs defined here are applied to _all_ packages
  materialized: view   # but can be overridden in more specific configs below
