# Singer Spec

The Singer Specification is an open source standard for defining the format of data and information. 
The standard is useful because it enables Data Professionals to move data between arbritrary systems as long as the programs generating and ingesting the data can understand this format.

## Version

The current version of the Spec is 0.3.0. The original documentation is in the [Singer IO](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md) project on GitHub.

## Basics

### 3 Messages

The full specification for data exchange consistes of three types of JSON-formatted messages: `schema`, `record`, and `state`. The `record` message contains the actual data being communicated, the `schema` message defines the structure of the data, and the `state` message keeps track of the progress of an extraction.

An example of what these messages look like is here:

```bash
{"type": "SCHEMA", "stream": "users", "key_properties": ["id"], "schema": {"required": ["id"], "type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "integer"}}}}
{"type": "RECORD", "stream": "users", "record": {"id": 1, "name": "Chris"}}
{"type": "RECORD", "stream": "users", "record": {"id": 2, "name": "Mike"}}
{"type": "SCHEMA", "stream": "locations", "key_properties": ["id"], "schema": {"required": ["id"], "type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "integer"}}}}
{"type": "RECORD", "stream": "locations", "record": {"id": 1, "name": "Philadelphia"}}
{"type": "STATE", "value": {"users": 2, "locations": 1}}
```

These messages are sent to standard output, aka `stdout`, and can be consumed by passing them to standard input, aka `stdin`. This is done on the commmand line using the pipe `|` parameter which will redirect each message to whatever is specified on the other side of the pipe. 

### Taps

These 3 message types are generated by programs called `taps`. A tap can be written in any programming language as long as its only output is the 3 message types. Taps are required to accept 1 file, called a configuration (config) file, and can optionally accept 2 other files called state and catalog files. 

The config file is a JSON-formatted file containing any information needed for a tap to run. This can include authorization information such as username and password, date parameters to specify when to start extracting, and anything else useful for pulling a specific set of data.

### JSON

[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is the abbreviation of JavaScript Object Notation. This is a human-readable data format that is almost universally used in many computing applications. An example JSON object:

    ```json
    {
    "program": "Meltano",
    "protocol": "Singer",
    "is_active": true,
    "age": 3,
    "address": {
        "global": true,
        "streetAddress": null,
        }
    }
    ```
