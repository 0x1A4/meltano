# Installation

In this section, we will install Meltano as an application you can access from your browser and command line. If you prefer to install to Docker, please view the installation instructions [here](/docs/tutorial.html#using-docker).

::: warning
We do not have a double click installer at this time, but it is in our roadmap and we will be sure to update this page when we do!
:::

## Requirements

Before you install meltano with `pip install meltano` make sure you have the following requirements installed and up to date.

### Python 3+

- [Python 3.6.1+](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

::: tip
You may refer to [https://realpython.com/installing-python/](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) for platform specific installation instructions.
:::

To check if you have the correct Python version, open your terminal and use the following commands to check the version:

```bash
$ python --version
Python 3.6.1
```

### pip

`pip` is a package installer that comes automatically with Python 3+. This is also what we will be using to install Meltano. Here are some commands related to `pip` that may be of interest:

```bash
# Check for current version of pip
$ pip --version

# Update pip
$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

::: tip
If `pip`/`python` is not working, try `pip3`/`python3` instead. This would be the case if you have both Python 2+ *and* 3+ installed.
:::

### Virtual Environment

::: danger
Meltano must be installed inside a virtual environment, unless you are building a Docker image.
:::

We suggest you create a directory where you want your virtual environments to be saved, e.g.:
  - **Linux, OSX**:  `~/virtualenvs`
  - **Windows**: `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\virtualenvs`

Then create a new virtual environment inside that directory:

```bash
# Linux, OSX
$ mkdir ~/virtualenvs
$ python -m venv ~/virtualenvs/meltano

# Windows
$ mkdir %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\virtualenvs
$ python -m venv %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\virtualenvs\\meltano
```

Then, you will need to activate the virtual environment using:

```bash
# Linux, OSX
$ source ~/virtualenvs/meltano/bin/activate

# Windows
$ %HOME%\\virtualenvs\\meltano\\Scripts\\activate.bat
```

## Installing Meltano

Now that you have your virtual environment set up and running, navigate to the directory where you want to install Meltano and run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install meltano
```

Once the installation completes, you can check if it was successful by running:

```bash
$ meltano --version
meltano, version X.XX.X
```

That's it! Meltano is now be available for you to use. Now we can [create a Meltano project](/docs/quickstart.html).

::: tip
Once a virtual environment is activated, it stays active until the current shell is closed.

You must re-activate the virtual environment before interacting with Meltano. 
To streamline this process, you can add the `meltano` executable directly in your `PATH`.

```bash
# Linux, OSX
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/virtualenvs/meltano/bin/meltano

# Windows
setx PATH "%PATH%;%ALLUSERPROFILES\virtualenvs\meltano\Scripts\meltano"
```

## Upgrading Meltano

We release new versions of Meltano weekly. To update Meltano to the latest version, run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ pip install --upgrade meltano
```

Follow along on the [Meltano blog](https://meltano.com/blog/) to keep tabs on the latest releases, or visit our [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Deploying Meltano

To learn more about deplying Meltano on services like AWS, check out our [Deployment docs](/docs/deployment.html).

## Advanced: Install on Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an alternative installation option to [using a virtual environment to run Meltano](http://localhost:8080/docs/installation.html#virtual-environment). To use these instructions you will need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) onto your computer and have it running when you execute the commands below.

### Using Pre-built Docker Images

We provide the [meltano/meltano](https://hub.docker.com/r/meltano/meltano) docker image with Meltano pre-installed and ready to use.

> Note: The **meltano/meltano** docker image is also available in GitLab's registry: `registry.gitlab.com`

This image contains everything you need to get started with Meltano.

```bash
# to download or update to the latest version
$ docker pull meltano/meltano

# to look the currently installed version
$ docker run meltano/meltano --version
meltano, version â€¦
```

#### Initialize Your Project

Once you have Docker installed, running, and have pulled the pre-built image you can use Meltano just as you would in our Quickstart Guide. However, the command line syntax is slightly different. For example, let's create a new Meltano project:

```
$ docker run -v $(pwd):/projects \
             -w /projects \
             meltano/meltano init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

Then you can `cd` into your new project:

```
$ cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

We can then start the Meltano UI.

```
# `ui` is the default command, we can omit it.
$ docker run -v $(pwd):/project \
             -w /project \
             -p 5000:5000 \
             meltano/meltano
```
You can now visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the Meltano UI.

If you are a Meltano end-user who is not going to be contributing code to our open source repository, you should be able to use Meltano entirely from the UI at this point. 

Follow the steps in our [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart.html) to get started.

### For Contributors: Example Command Line Syntax for Docker ###

 Here are some example of CLI commands you may need to run if you are working with Meltano as an open source contributor:

#### Running the ELT from the Command Line
To run the ELT and extract some data from the **tap-carbon-intensity** into **target-sqlite**:

```
$ docker run -v $(pwd):/project \
             -w /project \
             meltano/meltano elt tap-carbon-intensity target-sqlite
```

#### Adding a Model from the Command Line

Now that we have data in your database, let's add the corresponding model bundle as the basis of our analysis.

```
$ docker run -v $(pwd):/project \
             -w /project \
             meltano/meltano add model model-carbon-intensity-sqlite
```
