# Roadmap

## Meltano is the market (data science) life cycle, just like GitLab is the product (DevOps) life cycle.

For many companies GitLab serves as the single data store for their engineering organization, shepherding their ideas all the way through to delivering them to customers. There are key gaps however in understanding the effectiveness of sales and marketing. By expanding the common data store to include go to market information, additional insights can be drawn across the customer life cycle. This evolution is as follows:

1. Business intelligence; this is the current state of the project.
2. Data science; add more machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
3. Market life cycle; the complete go-to-market life cycle with the user/customer journey.

## Evolution from an internal project, to a community, to open core

1. We are building Meltano to solve a problem that GitLab shares with all other software companies - how to acquire the highest-value customers at the lowest cost of acquisition? We are solving this problem for ourselves first, incorporating what we learn along the way into a product that delivers practical and quantifiable value to our customers.
1. Next, we'll focus on building a community around Meltano with more users and regular contributors to the code base.
1. Right now Meltano is open source. In the future we'll introduce proprietary features to have a sustainable business model to do quality control, marketing, security, dependency upgrades, and performance improvements. An example of a proprietary/source available feature is fine grained access controls. We'll always be good [stewards similar to GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/stewardship/).
