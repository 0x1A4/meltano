# Plugin Management

## Adding extractors and loaders to your project

Like all types of plugins, extractors and loaders can be added to a Meltano project using [`meltano add`](/docs/command-line-interface.html#add).

Plugins that are already [known to Meltano](/docs/contributor-guide.html#known-plugins) can be added by simply specifying their `type` and `name`, while adding a plugin that Meltano isn't familiar with yet requires adding the `--custom` flag.

To find out what plugins are already known to Meltano and supported out of the box, you can use [`meltano discover`](/docs/command-line-interface.html#discover), with an optional pluralized `plugin type` argument.
You can also check out the lists of supported [extractors](/plugins/extractors/) and [loaders](/plugins/loaders/) on this website.

If the Singer tap or target you'd like to use with Meltano doesn't show up in any of these places, you're going to want to [add a custom plugin](/docs/command-line-interface.html#how-to-use-custom-plugins).

```bash
# List extractors and loaders known to Meltano
meltano discover extractors
meltano discover loaders

# Add a known extractor or loader by name
meltano add extractor tap-salesforce
meltano add loader target-snowflake

# Add an unknown (custom) extractor or loader
meltano add --custom extractor tap-covid-19
```

## Installing your project's plugins

Whenever you add a new plugin to a Meltano project using [`meltano add`](/docs/command-line-interface.html#add),
it will be installed into your project's `.meltano` directory automatically.

However, since this directory is included in your project's `.gitignore` file
by default, you'll need to explicitly run [`meltano install`](/docs/command-line-interface.html#install)
before any other `meltano` commands whenever you clone or pull an existing Meltano project from version control,
to install (or update) all plugins specified in `meltano.yml`.
