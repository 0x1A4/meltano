# Getting Started

Welcome to Meltano! Meltano is your solution for taking you from data source to dashboard. What does that mean? It means we have you covered from:

- Model
- Extract
- Load
- Transform
- Analyze
- Notebook
- Orchestrate

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, there are a couple of things your environment has the following:

- [Python 3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (Optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Install Meltano CLI

Meltano provides a CLI to kickstart and help you manage the configuration and orchestration of all the components in the data lifecycle. It provides a single source of truth for the entire data pipeline. The CLI makes it easy to develop, run and debug every step of the data lifecycle.
